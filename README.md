I undertook this project for fun after I refreshed my knowledge of HTML/CSS from a codecademy course. The project is a company site for a fake company called PerformNYC. 
I was originally given the task to create a website for the company during my participation in America on Tech's Tech Flex Leaders program. I decided to expand upon 
the services the company offers and created seperate pages for each that branch off from the main. The link is below the about section on this page.
