This project is a redesigned version of a previous group project, originally created as part of my participation in America on Tech's Tech Flex Leaders program. Using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, I developed a more responsive layout with three dedicated HTML service pages to showcase the expanded offerings of a fictional company, PerformNYC. After refreshing my HTML/CSS skills through a Codecademy course, I undertook this redesign to improve the siteâ€™s usability and structure by creating separate pages for each service, accessible via links branching from the main page. This project demonstrates my ability to enhance and adapt existing work to create a more comprehensive and professional web presence.
